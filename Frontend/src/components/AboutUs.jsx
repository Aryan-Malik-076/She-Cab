              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              She-Cab was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate women who
              recognized the need for a safe and reliable transportation service
              tailored for women. Inspired by the challenges women face in
              commuting, we set out to create a solution that not only addresses
              safety concerns but also empowers women by providing employment
              opportunities as drivers.
